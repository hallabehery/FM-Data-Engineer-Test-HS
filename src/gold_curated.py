"""Gold `curated` — the final network product a graph tool can render directly.

`curated` is the presentation layer: it reads **only** from `data_mart` (never the
reverse) and reshapes the modelled network into the two tables a graph library
expects — `node` (`build_node`) and `edge` (`build_edge`).

`build_node` lands `curated.node`: exactly one row per node that participates in an
edge, typed by shape — **group nodes (circles)** for counterparts that resolve to one
of our groups, **standalone nodes (diamonds)** for those that do not. A node
participates if it appears on either end of a `data_mart.money_flow` row (as a
`focal_group_id` or a `counterpart_id`); its display attributes come from the
`data_mart.entity` dimension. Companies and group-resolved counterparties are *not*
nodes — the drill level and resolved counterparts are represented by their group's
circle — so they are excluded here (they carry no `node_shape` in `entity`).

`build_edge` lands `curated.edge`: the directed money-flow edges a graph tool renders
with no further transformation. Each edge carries directed endpoints, GBP volume,
transaction count and GBP fee revenue, is sliceable by `month` and `year` (year rolls
up from month by summation), and is drillable up/down the hierarchy via `focal_group_id`
(roll up) and `focal_company_id` (drill down) — both grains summing from the same rows.
